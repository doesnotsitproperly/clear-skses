# Clear SKSE Files

Command-line tool to delete SKSE files left behind after their corresponding saves have been deleted

Optional command-line argument for directory to scan, otherwise looks for `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\Saves` or `%USERPROFILE%\OneDrive\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\Saves`

**Deletes any SKSE file that does not have a matching ESS file, use at your own risk**
